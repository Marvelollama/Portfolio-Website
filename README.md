# Portfolio-Website
This is a simple, responsive portfolio website created to showcase my skills and projects as a Computer Science and Engineering student. The website is built using a HTML with Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Technologies Used
HTML5: The foundation for the website's structure.

CSS3 (via Tailwind CSS): A utility-first framework used for modern and responsive styling.

JavaScript (vanilla): Used for simple client-side interactions, such as the mobile navigation menu.

## Code Reference Guide
Below is a breakdown of the main HTML tags and attributes used in this project, explaining their purpose and function.

### index.html

* `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML being used, in this case, HTML5.
* `<html>`: The root element of an HTML page.
  * `lang="en"`: The `lang` attribute specifies the language of the document's content, which is helpful for accessibility and search engines.

* `<head>`: This section contains meta-information about the HTML document.
  * `<meta charset="UTF-8">`: The `charset` attribute specifies the character encoding for the HTML document. UTF-8 is the standard and includes almost all characters and symbols.
  * `<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">`: This is a useful meta tag that forces Internet Explorer to use its latest rendering engine.
  * `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`: A crucial tag for responsiveness. It tells the browser to set the page's width to the device's screen width, which is essential for mobile viewing.
  * `<title>Portfolio Website</title>`: The `title` tag defines the title of the document, which appears in the browser tab or window's title bar.
  * ` <link rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheet.css"> ` : The `<link>` tag links an external css file "stylesheet.css" to the HTML document.

* `<body>`: This is where all the visible content of the website is located.

### stylesheet.css

* ` *{} `: This is the universal selector. It applies specific styles to every single element on the page.
* ` font-family: 'poppins', sans-serif; `: It sets the font to 'poppins' and sets default to 'sans-serif', incase 'poppins' is not available.
* ` .navbar a:hover { ... }`: A pseudo-class which applies style when a user hovers their mouse over a link.
* ` pseudo-class `: It is used to define style for an element when it is in a particular state.
